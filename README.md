Python script file that keeps your downloads organized.

It creates subfolders in your download folder and organizes there files that previously have been stored in downloads.

Initially, there are only 3 subfolders, but you can create as many as you can, only you should specify extensions that will be put in this subfolder (in the “extensions” 2-d array)
